# Children's Mobile Library App (Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL) 

A children's library app project to let a librarian manage their book collection and membership. 
A librarian should be able to create/view/update/delete books and members, loan books out and return them.
I also added the option to filter the book collection by age range and to be able to search for a book by author or title.

This is my first full stack app. We had 5 days to complete the project.

This project was set during a software development course to consolidate learning in:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

The project could be built using only:

* HTML / CSS (no pre-built CSS libraries)
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem
